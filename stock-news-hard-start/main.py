## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

    up_down = "ðŸ”»"

diff_percent = (difference / float(yesterday_data_closing_price)) * 100
print(f"Price change: {diff_percent:.2f}%")
    



## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
if diff_percent > 5:  # Temporarily lowered for testing

    news_res.raise_for_status()
    articles = news_res.json()["articles"]
    three_articles = articles[:3]


## STEP 3: use Email to send a message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your own email address and then send yourself a separate email for each article.
#HINT 1: Use the format below to send the message.
    formatted_articles = [f'{STOCK}: {up_down}{round(diff_percent)}%\nHeadline: {article["title"]}. \nBrief: {article["description"]}' for article in three_articles]
    print(formatted_articles)
